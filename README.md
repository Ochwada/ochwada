## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Niaje!

As a Geoinformatics Expert, I have dedicated my career to empowering tomorrow's geospatial innovations. Currently, I am making strides in the realm of GeoTech Sales. My journey has seen me harness advanced technologies like machine learning to address pressing challenges, particularly in the potential of GeoAI. Beyond my professional roles, I have been recognized as a public speaker and panelist, sharing insights in "Der Deutscher Bundestag", "Black in Tech", and the "Geospatial World Forum" among others. 

I am also open to learning about technology - especially in Software Development and Data Science. 

While I do embrace the professional roles, my primary commitment is to champion GeoTech innovations and solutions, always seeking new avenues to share the transformative power of GeoAI. I indulge in anime, coding for fun, traveling, and cherish moments with my family in my free time.
