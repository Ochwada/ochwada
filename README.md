# 👋 Hi there, I'm  Ochwada!

 I'm a geospatial technologist, software developer, and technical leader passionate about building meaningful tools that solve real-world problems.

## 🧭 About Me

-  **Geospatial & Environmental Enthusiast**  
  I specialize in remote sensing, GIS, and Earth observation, using spatial data to analyze, visualize, and protect our environment.

-  **Full-Stack Developer in Progress**  
  I work with Java (Spring Boot), JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Next.js), and Python to create secure, efficient, and impactful applications.

-  **AI + GeoAI Explorer**  
  I'm currently building AI-powered geospatial apps, including car and building detection tools using satellite imagery and deep learning.

-  **Entrepreneur & Team Leader**  
  As a co-founder and Technical Managing Director, I drive cross-functional projects from idea to execution while mentoring others.

-  **Lifelong Learner**  
  I'm always learning — from backend systems and databases to data pipelines, microservices, and mobile-first app design.
